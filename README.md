# pred
**pced but it's rust**  
This is a rewrite of my pced editor in Rust. Currently no code is being written yet, I am still learning Rust and doing stuff with pced (possibly minimal vi emulation and bugfixing, maybe I could write pred in pced)

# Goals
- make something that works
- stuff

# Obstacles
- memory management (rely on the OS? inform the OS somehow? write my own?)
- UI
- yes
